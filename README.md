# unit-4-game

## Description
This is a JavaScript game utilizing the jQuery library. At the start of the game a target score between 19-120 will be randomly generated. Each of the four crystals will also be assigned a random value 1-12. The crystal values will not be displayed to the player. 

Each time a crystal is clicked its value will be added to the current score. The object of the game is to click on the crystals in such a way that the sum of all the crystals clicked equals the target score; this will constitute a win for the player which will be displayed at the bottom of the page. If the current score goes over the target score the game ends and the player loses; the losses display at the bottom of the page will be incremented. 

Once the player wins or loses a new target score and crystal values will be generated.
